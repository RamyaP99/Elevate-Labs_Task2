### Visualizations

The dashboard includes five key visualizations, each addressing a specific business question:
1) Sales and Profit Trends (Line Chart):
   
   Purpose: Tracks sales and profit over time (2014-2018, by Quarter).
   
   Insight: Sales peak in Q4 (30-40% of $2.3M), but profit (~$300K) dips due to discounts.
   
   Recommendation: Boost Q4 Technology campaigns; optimize discounts.
3) Profit Contribution by Product Category and Sub-Category (Stacked Bar Chart):
   
   Purpose: Shows profit by Category (e.g., Technology) and Sub-Category (e.g., Phones).
   
   Insight: Technology drives 60% of profit (~$150K-$200K); Tables/Binders show losses.
   
   Recommendation: Prioritize Technology inventory; review Tables/Binders pricing.
   
6) Discount Impact on Profit by Product Category (Scatter Plot):
   
   Purpose: Analyzes how discounts affect profitability across Categories.
   
   Insight: Discounts >30% cause Furniture losses; Technology sustains profits at 10-20%.
   
   Recommendation: Cap discounts at 20% for Furniture/Office Supplies.
   
8) Sales Distribution by Customer Segment (Donut Chart):
   
   Purpose: Shows sales distribution across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.
   
   Insight: Consumer drives 50% of sales (~$1.2M), Corporate ~30%, Home Office ~20%.
   
   Recommendation: Target Consumer loyalty; upsell Corporate, grow Home Office.
   
10) Regional Performance: Sales vs. Profit (Clustered Bar Chart):
    
    Purpose: Compares sales and profit across Regions (West, East, Central, South).
   
    Insight: West (~$700K sales, ~$100K profit) and East lead; Central lags ($30K profit).
   
    Recommendation: Focus resources on West/East; optimize Central pricing.
